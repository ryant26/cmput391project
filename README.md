## BootStrap
All of the bootstrap stuff is in /dist. If you download themes, point their paths to that directory.

## /resc
This is the resources folder, right now there is a single .css file in there for the index file jsut as an example. Please put any other .css files or resources into a subdirectory in this folder.

## Tomcat
I recommend that you clone this repository somewhere in your user space and symlink it into the webapps directory of your tomcat install. That way you don't have to sudo for every opperations. 

## Development 
I made the assumption we will be using text editors for development. Creating a dynamic web project in eclipse makes a lot of extra files and folders. If you'd really like to be able to import this into eclipse I'll try to get that working.
